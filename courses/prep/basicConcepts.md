## Software
* Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built
* In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data
* Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media
* Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own

## Computer program
* A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer
* A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit
* A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language
* From the program in its human-readable form of source code, a compiler can derive machine codeâ€”a form consisting of instructions that the computer can directly execute
* Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreter
* A part of a computer program that performs a well-defined task is known as an algorithm. 
* A collection of computer programs, libraries and related data are referred to as software
* Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines, such as application software or system software

## Application software
* An application program (app or application for short) is a computer program designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user
* Examples of an application include a word processor, a spreadsheet, an accounting application, a web browser, a media player, an aeronautical flight simulator, a console game or a photo editor
* The collective noun application software refers to all applications collectively
* This contrasts with system software, which is mainly involved with running the computer
* Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately, and may be coded as proprietary, open-source or university projects
* Apps built for mobile platforms are called mobile apps
